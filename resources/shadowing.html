    <p>Healthcare students and professionals from all fields utilize shadowing to gain exposure to new fields and to better understand their motivations and interests. This includes undergraduate pre-medical students. It is a myth that one must have a previous connection with a physician before shadowing them. At a research university with teaching hospitals like the University of Minnesota, faculty are generally enthusiastic about allowing younger students to shadow, because there is an understanding and appreciation of the influence that immersion in professional settings can have on young students. So don’t be afraid!</p>
    <p>The first step in shadowing is identifying potential physicians or other healthcare professionals you wish to shadow. We will focus on surgery in this article, but these steps apply to all healthcare fields.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Take advantage of the University’s elaborate department websites and faculty listing. Faculty are physicians who are part of the University of Minnesota who have completed education at least to their residency.
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.surgery.umn.edu/about/our-faculty/faculty-division">http://www.surgery.umn.edu/about/our-faculty/faculty-division</a>: This is a list of faculty surgeons in the Department of Surgery at the University of Minnesota.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.surgery.umn.edu/education-training/residencies/general-surgery-residency/meet-current-residents">http://www.surgery.umn.edu/education-training/residencies/general-surgery-residency/meet-current-residents</a>: This is a list of current general surgery residents.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.neurosurgery.umn.edu/faculty-residents-and-staff/faculty">https://www.neurosurgery.umn.edu/faculty-residents-and-staff/faculty</a>: This is a list of Neurosurgery Department Faculty.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.neurosurgery.umn.edu/faculty-residents-and-staff/current-residents">https://www.neurosurgery.umn.edu/faculty-residents-and-staff/current-residents</a>: This is a list of current Neurosurgery residents.</li>
      </ul>
      Also use the University’s official email database to find the emails of physicians from their names (on your UMN email account, simply start typing the physician’s name into the address box and their email should appear).</li>
      <li>Write a brief, yet well-crafted email to them. Begin with, “Dear Dr. ____” and introduce yourself. You could include your year in undergrad and what you’re studying. Then, without giving them an essay to read, explain to them why you’re interested in their particular field, and why you would be grateful for the opportunity to shadow them. If you’ve read their publications or have learned specific information about their practice, you could briefly talk about this and about why you’d like to learn more. Be honest. You don’t need to impress them with a list of your achievements; expressing a genuine interest in their work is what will help you be successful.</li>
      <li>Give them about three days to respond to you, and consider sending a second email if they haven’t responded after that time. It is helpful if you send the second email as a reply to the thread of the first email, so that they’re reminded of your initial request again when they get your second email. It is not rude to email physicians a second time like this; the faculty and physicians often become extremely busy and replying to your email may slip their mind amongst their many other responsibilities, so they rely on you to send a follow-up that reminds them of your request. If some particular physician doesn’t respond after two emails, you could consider emailing any administrative assistant contacts they might have, or if you’re especially interested in a specific physician, stop by their office and leave a note. The key is to be persistent, and reach out to new faculty or residents if some are too busy or don’t respond.</li>
      <li>Once you have found a faculty member who has agreed to let you shadow, you will likely be put in contact with an administrative assistant who will send you forms that include HIPAA agreements/training (this involves private patient information – something to take very seriously), a description of your proposed clinical observation time, contact information, and you will also send in official documentation of your immunizations. This includes a requirement that within the past year you have a tuberculosis test which is negative. (If you don’t have this on file you can most likely make appointments at Boynton for the administration and later interpretation of your TB test). Once you send in the required documentation and it is approved, you will be able to obtain an observation badge for shadowing.</li>
      <li>Some tips for shadowing in the operating room:
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure you have a bouffant (surgical hair net), scrubs, and whatever other attire is required, whenever you’re entering the operating room areas. Be aware of this. When you are inside an operating room you will also need to wear a face mask.</li>
          <li>Do not touch anything in the operating room with any part of your body, except possibly when you write your name on the white board which lists all persons present for the operation. Identify yourself as someone who is shadowing to the staff in the OR, and have them instruct you on an appropriate place to go.</li>
          <li>If someone is moving near you, especially if they have scrubbed in and are in surgical scrubs, give them plenty of space to move about.</li>
          <li>Sometimes it’s appropriate to ask questions, but other times you must realize that the surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, surgical techs, etc., are busy and need to focus on the operation. With experience you will develop an intuition of when it is okay to ask a question.</li>
          <li>Be very professional and respectful (this goes for any setting). It is a privilege to observe patients undergoing operations, and we must always be aware of that both in and out of the operating room.</li>
          <li>If you don’t feel good, feel dizzy, etc., let someone in the operating room know and leave the operating room. Feeling faint or queasy is common for individuals who haven’t had much operative exposure before, and should not worry you. With time, a tolerance and capacity for seeing internal anatomy and fluids can be developed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>And any time you’re shadowing or exposed to health/patient information, be extremely careful never to repeat this information or to violate HIPAA.</p>

    <p>We wish you the best in your shadowing endeavors, and please don’t hesitate to reach out to a board member if you have questions or uncertainties in this area!</p>
