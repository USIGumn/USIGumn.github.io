    <h2><strong>Jack Hedberg</strong> &mdash; President</h2>
    <p><strong>Majors:</strong> Biochemistry and Physiology</p>
    <p><strong>Minors:</strong> Microbiology and Pharmacology</p>
    <p><strong>Interests</strong>: I’m drawn to surgery because of the
      calculated, collaborative environment
      of the operating room, the diverse repertoire of skills used by surgeons,
      and the potential to change someone's life by personally addressing the
      disease or injury that has brought them into the world of the sick. I'm
      particularly attracted to trauma surgery because of its intense
      environment and because I want to help people through the most
      vulnerable points in their lives.</p>

    <h2> <strong>Marissa Peyer</strong> &mdash; Director of Finance</h2>
    <p><strong>Major:</strong> Biochemistry</p>
    <p><strong>Minor:</strong> Spanish</p>
    <p><strong>Interests:</strong> In general, I am really interested in working
      with people over a span of time. I really like the idea of getting to know
      my patients and, even though I might only be performing one surgery on them,
      to really get to know their story and to see them recover and return back
      to their normal life. Although I like the field of surgery in general, I
      really like orthopedic and trauma surgery. I think that each field holds
      its own kind of challenge and helps people to get back to their lives and
      what they enjoy doing. I am currently leaving my mind open to all of the
      fields in medicine, as I will only really know what I am truly passionate
      about after I explore my options in medical school.</p>

    <h2><strong>Polina Prokhoda</strong> &mdash; Public Relations Chair</h2>
    <p><strong>Major:</strong> Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development</p>
    <p><strong>Minor:</strong> Psychology</p>
    <p><strong>Interests:</strong> I'm interested in Ophthalmology, because, as a
      person with bad vision, I understand the importance of seeing clearly in a
      person's day to day life. Besides bad vision, the eyes can experience
      several other problems, including cataracts and infectious diseases. When
      faced with these problems, people become miserable, the eyes are a very
      sensitive organ, and need to remain healthy in order for a person to
      function to their full potential. I would like to help people see better,
      and eliminate eye problems from their every day lives. Specifically
      talking about surgery, Lasik surgery is a minimally invasive procedure,
      which can improve a person's vision, as well as their confidence and
      comfort. The surgery itself is almost artistic in nature, working in a very
      confined area that requires a keen and detail-oriented eye, and this type
      of work appeals to me.</p>

    <img src="resources/leadership/Raghav.jpg" width="300" height="196" />
    <h2><strong>Raghav Vadhul</strong> &mdash; Events Coordinator</h2>
    <p><strong>Major:</strong> Biology</p>
    <p><strong>Minor:</strong> Neuroscience</p>
    <p><strong>Interests:</strong> I am interested in surgery because of
      its hands-on and evidence based natures. Although evidence based
      care is used in practically every field of medicine, it is especially
      important and impactful in the field of surgery. As new findings and
      cutting-edge technology are released regularly, surgeries are becoming
      more efficient and more complex and require a strong dedication to
      lifelong learning. This, combined with the hands-on practice of
      surgery, are what draw me to the field. Although I have this strong
      interest in surgery, I am actually undecided on which field I would
      like to go into. I have genuinely found every field of medicine
      fascinating, and I do not think I will be able to pick one until I
      (hopefully) explore them all more closely in medical school. This is
      also a good representation of what USIG itself stands for. Not only
      is the group for people who are certain they would like to go into
      surgery, but also for people like me who are still exploring the vast
      field of medicine.</p>

    <h2><strong>Shray Malik</strong> &mdash; Events Coordinator</h2>
    <p><strong>Major: </strong>Biochemistry</p>
    <p><strong>Minor: </strong>Neuroscience</p>
    <p><strong>Interests: </strong>The field of surgery captivates me due to the
      exquisite nature with which surgeons are able to make a major difference
      in others' lives. With teamwork, adaptability, resourcefulness, and an
      extensive knowledge of the human body, surgeons are able to save lives on
      a day-to-day basis and I hope to be able to do that one day. I am
      particularly interested in the field of Cardiothoracic Surgery because the
      anatomy and physiology of the heart and lungs is truly amazing to me and
      it is something I could never get bored of.</p>

    <img src="resources/leadership/Ajinkya.png" alt="DSC_0023 (1)" width="298" height="300" />
    <h2><strong>Ajinkya Limkar</strong> &mdash; Director of Member Development</h2>
    <p><strong>Major:</strong> Microbiology</p>
    <p><strong>Minor:</strong> Chemistry</p>
    <p><strong>Interests:</strong> I'm interested in surgery, specifically
      pediatric or trauma surgery, because it incorporates the the two things
      I value greatly; continuous acquisition of knowledge i.e lifelong
      learning, and helping others in order to make a positive impact on their
      lives. In regards to both surgical fields, especially trauma, patients
      are most probably at their lowest before having surgery, they're
      afraid, anxious, and distraught. The idea that someone can help them,
      bring them down to the level of calm just by doing their job, amazes
      me. The field of surgery also fascinates me because it incorporates
      the basic sciences of biology, chemistry, etc. with cutting-edge
      technological advancements. It would be the perfect mix of human
      contact, science and discovery, and helping others, it would really
      be my ideal career.</p>

    <h2><strong>Heena Shah</strong> &mdash; Director of Public Relations</h2>
    <p><strong>Major:</strong> Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development</p>
    <p><strong>Minor:</strong> Philosophy</p>
    <p><strong>Interests:</strong> I admire the way surgeons are able to
      “stitch” together biology and ethics to potentially give their
      patients second chances at healthy living during the most susceptible
      moments in their lives. I do not have a particular field of surgery
      that I am more drawn to, which is one of the main reasons why I am so
      thrilled to be a member of this organization. I hope to represent
      those who have a deep passion for medicine but are unaware of what
      adventure it will lead them to.</p>

    <img src="resources/leadership/Varsha.png" width="300" height="258" />
    <h2><strong>Varsha Goduguchinta</strong> &mdash; Director of Board Conferences</h2>
    <p><strong>Major:</strong> Biology</p>
    <p><strong>Interests:</strong> I am fascinated with surgery because of
      its innovative and collaborative nature in medicine that allows
      surgeons to continuously learn. The diverse fields of surgery all 
      incorporate a hands-on perspective that allows doctors to connect
      with patients on a different level. I am particularly interested in
      pediatrics or orthopedic surgery because I love working with young
      patients and watching them recover rapidly. Orthopedic surgery is
      also fascinating because of it involves fixing the body’s movement
      with the use of precision and brute force. But, because each field
      holds a different set of challenges and benefits, I am open to
      exploring all the fields in medicine in medical school.</p>

    <h2><strong>Peter Humbert</strong> &mdash; Webmaster</h2>
    <p><strong>Major:</strong> Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics</p>
    <p><strong>Minors:</strong> Computer Science and Business Law</p>
    <p><strong>Interests:</strong> Although my interests are not related to
      surgery, it is easy to appreciate the similarities between surgery
      and engineering. Members of both professions must ensure the safety
      of those they serve while working in a collaborative and rigorous
      environment. In being a part of this group, I look forward to seeing
      how these similarities are expressed in medical environments and
      comparing their contextual nuances to those found in an engineering
      context.</p>
